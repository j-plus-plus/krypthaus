## What?

Krypthaus is the first instant messaging system to guarantee absolute privacy. You no longer need to worry about your naughty secrets getting into the dirty hands of the government.

## Why?

In the morning when you turn on your radio do you hear static? Do you feel like you're being followed by men in black suits? Do you think that NSA or Mossad is interested in you? Do you want to send messages that no one besides the recepient can read? Then Krypthaus is just for you!

## How?

Krypthaus utilises a one-time pad encryption technique that cannot be cracked (provided the password is private). In this technique, a plaintext is paired with a random secret key (or pad) that will be used exactly once. To start sending ecrypted messages the key must be exchanged beforehand.
